In this lab you will learn to implement different text-preprocessing techniques commonly used for NLP tasks as well as implement a standard text-classification algorithm for categorizing different news articles.\n","\n","We assume that you are familiar with `python` programming language, and its libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. We will also make use of other libraries like `nltk` and `pytorch` in the assignment. Familiarity with these libraries is not assumed so we will provide short tutorials on their usage within the assignment.\n","\n","Expected learning outcomes from this Lab include:\n","- Understand and implement text pre-processing techniques for NLP tasks\n","- Gain understanding of count / frequency based bag of word models for performing text classification\n","- Learn how to use Pytorch to define and train models for text classification"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"KFWd9il4Lu7T","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715145977998,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":36256,"user":{"displayName":"Rajat

Θ denotes the model parameters, J is the loss function and α is what we call learning rate which is used to specify the strength of the step that we wish to take. A smaller learning rate ensures we do not move away from the minima, but it makes the learning slower, while with a larger learning rate we move quickly towards the minima but are susceptible to overshooting it. Variants of SGD like SGD + Momentum, RMSProp, Adam etc., tries to improve it's noisy nature (which arises due to the fact we work on batches, instead of the entire dataset at a time), by introducing minor modifications to the update equation to prevent the optimizer taking a step in an overly wrong direction, and some also introduce heuristics to decay the step size as we reach closer to the minima. Adam is one of the most used optimizers in Deep Learning applications and often works reasonably well in practical applications. We will use the same for our experiments. You can read more about how these different optimizers work [here](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/).\n","\n","`torch.optim` provides implementations for all of the optimizers we mentioned above.

There are different performance metrics that can be used for evaluating machine learning algorithms. One of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating classification models is accuracy which is defined as the number of test examples predicted correctly by the model divided by the total number of test
